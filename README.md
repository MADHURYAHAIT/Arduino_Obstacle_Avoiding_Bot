# Arduino Obstacle Avoiding Bot :

<h2> Here is the full source code of Arduino Bot.</h2>
i have also provided with the connections so you don't need to look for anyother resources.

After several iterations and fine-tuning, the  bot successfully stops if an object is closer than 15cm, takes a step back, checks left and right for obstacles using the ultrasonic sensor, and turns in the direction where the next obstacle's distance is greater.
